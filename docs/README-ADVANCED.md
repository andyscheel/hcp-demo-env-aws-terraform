## Advanced

### Add more worker nodes?

Set the variable `worker_count=` in `etc/bluedata_infra.tfvars` to the desired number.

```
# check the changes that will be done in the output - don't forget to approve when prompted
./bin/terraform_apply.sh

# run a script to prepare the worker - follow the prompts and instructions.
./scripts/bluedata_prepare_worker.sh
```

### Destroy complete environment when finished

```
# check the changes that will be done in the output - don't forget to approve when prompted
./bin/terraform_destroy.sh
```

### Shutdown/Restart EC2 instances as required

Some scripts were generated by terraform for this:

- `./generated/cli_stop_ec2_instances.sh` to stop your instances
- `./generated/cli_start_ec2_instances.sh` to start your instances
- `./generated/cli_running_ec2_instances.sh` to view running instances
